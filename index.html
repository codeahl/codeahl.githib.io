									<h2>About<br />
									</h2>
								</header>
								<p> I have been involved and interested in all things computers since before I attended high school. 
									However, in 2020, with too much time on my hands, I began to teach myself the fundementals of programming. Over the years I 
									have become more fluent in many languages, on top of applying my skills to problem solving in the classroom. I am currently a student 
									attending Iowa State University in the Software Engineering program with an expeced graduation year of late 2026 to early 2027.
								</p>

									<h2>Skills</h2>
								</header>
									<p>I am well versed in OOP, using mostly Java and Python, Web Development(HTML, CSS, 
										JS), C/C++, CAD. I have also ensured that I am comfortable debugging code that is not mine or code that I am not familiar with.
										 On top of the computer based skills, I clearly communicate my ideas and additions in a collaborative team based environment.
										Strong work ethic, and I put effort towards learning regardless of the difficulty of the task.

								<p>Built a logic circuit sandbox in order to help students get a visual and hands on understanding of bitwise logic and basic ALU design. This was built entirely from scratch in Java.</p>
								<video controls="controls">
									<source src="projectDemo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
								</video>
								<p>This project uses keyboard input form the user and mouse inputs to place a gate or node which are represented by a colored square 
								used, those being: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR. The light blue squares are the intial inputs, or switches, which give an 
								output value of either 1 or 0. the AND gate is colored white, the Or gate yellow, the NOT gate dark blue, the NAND gate red, the NOR 
								gate green, the XOR gate pink, and the XNOR gate orange. The output squares are a shade of gray, either light gray (indicating on) or dark gray 
								(indicating off).</p>
								<p>Each node which can be placed has a set keyboard input on the numpad, and the ability to translate your screen in all 4 directions is controlled 
									by the arrow keys. On top of this, a zoom function was implemented using scalars to increase and decrease the size of each object about the center of the panel.
								</p>
								<p>This video demonstration shows the creation of a full-adder circuit in the program. This works by connecting each of the gates, clicking on the output of the 
								last node first, and then the node which you would like to have the input as.</p>
								<p>The purpose of this website was not only to challenge ourselves, but to be used as a way for students who have a small amount or no experience with logic circuits 
									and bitwise operation

									<h2>Other Projects</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Created and designed multiple HTML/CSS/JS websites as freelance work and practice.</p>
								<p>Created multiple smaller projects in Python, JavaScript, Java, and C as practice to help better my understanding and applications of the languages.</p>
